### Towards Helping Novice Web Developers Debug JavaScript

Abstract: Many novice programmers often get introduced to programming through web development, using JavaScript as an introductory programming language. JavaScript programmers often rely on browser devTools to debug their programs. The error messages in web browsers get logged into the web console, which is a part of the devTools. However, novice programmers find it difficult to understand and interpret the error messages. Therefore, we propose JestViz, a tool aimed at helping novice web developers through modification the error reporting mechanism and visualization of the stack trace from error messages as a function call graph. We conjecture that these improvements provide novice programmers with a better interpretation of program errors, leading to faster debugging. Our evaluation of JestViz with undergraduate students showed that those who used JestViz took 46% lesser time to debug the program and gained an improved understanding of the inputs and nested function calls that produced the errors.
